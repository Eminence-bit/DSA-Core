# DSA-Core-Week1

## 📌 Purpose
This repository contains my focused 7-day drill to build deep mastery of core **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts using **algorithm-first thinking**.  
The goal is not just to solve problems, but to solve them *optimally* with **real algorithmic understanding**.

---

## 🎯 Weekly Goal
- 📅 **Start Date:** July 16, 2025
- ⏱️ **End Date:** July 22, 2025
- 🧮 **Target:** Solve **30 problems**
- 🧠 **Rule:** No brute-only solutions. If brute is used, optimal must follow.
- 📁 **Organization:** Easy / Medium / Hard directories with problem-specific folders
